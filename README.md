INVISIBILITY CLOAK PROJECT



This is a fun project which I made in a very few time.This makes you inivisible as I have used 'OpenCV' and 'NumPy'.

This project detects a coloured cloak (red,green,blue) and replaces it with the bg in real-time, creating an invisibility effect.



FEATURES OF THE PROJECT:



-Works with all 'red, green and blue cloaks'.

-Ral-time webcam processing

-Adjustable HSV ranges for better accuracy

-Human-Friendly mirror effect
